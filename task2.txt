Difference between document and window object!!!

    Document object:
        Document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
        By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
        The document object can be accessed with a window.document or document.
        The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
        Syntax:
            document.property_name;

        Syntax for method:
            document.method_name;


    Window Object: 
        The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
        It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
        Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

        Syntax:
            window.property_name;

        Syntax for mthod:
            window.method_name;
